  <h2> Chocolate Avacado  </h2>
  <pre>
    
    Ingredients:

For the Caramel:

½ cup granulated sugar
For the Flan:

1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk
4 large eggs, at room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
For the Chocolate Cake:

1 (15.25-ounce) box devil's food cake mix
1 cup water
3 large eggs
½ cup vegetable oil
Instructions:

Preheat the Oven: Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C).

Prepare the Caramel: In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the granulated sugar without stirring much. Once it begins to melt around the edges, swirl the pan gently to distribute the melted sugar. Continue heating until the sugar turns a deep amber color.

Coat the Pan:  Immediately pour the hot caramel into a 12-cup bundt pan or fluted tube pan. Tilt the pan to evenly coat the bottom and sides. Caution: The caramel will be very hot, so handle with care.

Make the Flan Batter: In a blender, combine the sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, eggs, and vanilla extract. Blend until smooth and well combined.

Prepare the Cake Batter:  In a large bowl, whisk together the cake mix, water, eggs, and vegetable oil according to the package instructions.

Assemble the Chocoflan: Carefully pour the cake batter over the caramel layer in the prepared pan. Don't worry if the batter doesn't completely cover the caramel.

Slowly Pour the Flan:  Next, slowly pour the flan batter on top of the cake batter. It's important to do this slowly to avoid disturbing the layers.

Water Bath Magic:  To ensure even cooking, create a water bath. Place the pan in a larger baking dish and carefully pour hot water into the outer dish, reaching about halfway up the sides of the pan with the chocoflan.

Bake and Cool: Bake the chocoflan in the preheated oven for 1.5 to 2 hours, or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.

Cool Completely:  Once baked, remove the chocoflan from the oven and let it cool completely on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes.

Invert and Unmold:  Carefully place a large serving plate upside down over the pan. Holding both the plate and the pan firmly, flip them together in one swift motion to invert the chocoflan onto the plate. Gently lift the pan to release the chocoflan.

Chill and Serve: Refrigerate the chocoflan for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow it to set completely. Serve chilled and enjoy the delicious combination of chocolate cake and creamy flan!</pre>
