  <h2> Chocolate Avacado  </h2>
  <pre>
    
    Ingredients:

2 ripe mangoes (Alphonso or Kesar mangoes are preferred for their sweetness)
¼ cup to ½ cup sugar (adjust based on mango sweetness)
¼ cup milk or water (optional, for adjusting consistency)
Pinch of cardamom powder (optional)
A squeeze of lemon juice (optional)
Instructions:

Prep the Mangoes: Wash the mangoes thoroughly under running water. Pat them dry with a clean kitchen towel.

Extract the Pulp: There are two ways to extract the pulp:

Peeling and Chopping: Peel the mangoes using a vegetable peeler or a sharp knife. Cut the flesh away from the pit and chop it into small pieces.

Scooping: This method works best for very ripe mangoes. Slice the mango in half lengthwise, avoiding the pit. Using a spoon, gently scoop out the flesh from the peel.

Blend the Pulp: Transfer the chopped or scooped mango flesh to a blender or food processor. Add sugar to taste. Start with ¼ cup and adjust according to the sweetness of your mangoes.

Achieve the Perfect Texture: Blend the mango pieces until you get a smooth and creamy consistency. You can add a splash of milk or water if the mixture seems too thick. However, be mindful not to add too much liquid,  as you don't want a runny aamras.

Flavor Twists (Optional):  For a touch of extra flavor, you can add a pinch of cardamom powder or a squeeze of lemon juice to the blender at this stage.

Chill and Serve:  Pour the aamras into a serving bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow it to chill.

Enjoy! Serve your aamras cold. It's traditionally enjoyed with puris (deep-fried flatbread) or rotis (flatbreads cooked on a griddle). You can also savor it on its own as a refreshing summer dessert</pre>
