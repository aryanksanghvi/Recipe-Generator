  <h2> Chocolate Avacado  </h2>
  <pre>
    
    Ingredients:

2 ripe avocados, peeled and pitted (around 16 oz)
¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
⅓ cup maple syrup (or preferred sweetener)
½ cup unsweetened plant-based milk (almond, cashew, coconut)
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
¼ teaspoon salt
Optional: Chocolate chips, chopped nuts, or berries for topping

Instructions:

Prep the Avocados:  Scoop the avocado flesh into a blender or food processor.

Combine Dry Ingredients:  Add the cocoa powder, maple syrup, and salt to the blender.

Blend Until Smooth:  Start blending on low speed, then gradually increase to high. Blend for about 1-2 minutes, or until the mixture is completely smooth and creamy.

Add Milk and Vanilla:  Pour in the plant-based milk and vanilla extract. Blend for another 30 seconds to a minute, until fully incorporated.

Taste and Adjust:  Give the mousse a taste! You can adjust the sweetness with additional maple syrup, or add a pinch more cocoa powder for a richer chocolate flavor.

Chill and Serve:  Pour the mousse into serving dishes (ramekins, glasses, bowls) and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until set.

Top and Enjoy!  Before serving, garnish your chocolate avocado mousse with your favorite toppings. Some ideas include chocolate chips, chopped nuts, fresh berries, a drizzle of melted chocolate, or a dollop of coconut whipped cream (made with chilled full-fat coconut milk).

Enjoy your delicious one-pot dal makhani!</pre>
