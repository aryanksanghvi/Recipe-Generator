  <h2>Delicious Chicken Rice</h2>
  <pre>One-Pot Chicken and Rice Recipe
    This flavorful and easy one-pot chicken and rice recipe is perfect for a weeknight meal. All the ingredients cook together in a single pot, minimizing cleanup!
    
    Ingredients:
    
    1 tablespoon olive oil
    1 medium onion, chopped
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    1.5 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
    1 teaspoon ground cumin
    1/2 teaspoon turmeric
    1/4 teaspoon chili powder (optional)
    1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes, undrained
    1 cup chicken broth
    1 3/4 cups long-grain white rice, rinsed
    1 cup frozen peas
    1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley (optional)
    Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
    Instructions:
    
    Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook for another minute, until fragrant.
    
    Add the chicken pieces, cumin, turmeric, and chili powder (if using). Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes.
    
    Stir in the diced tomatoes with their juices, chicken broth, and rinsed rice. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for 15 minutes.
    
    After 15 minutes, stir in the frozen peas. Continue simmering, covered, for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through and the chicken is tender.
    
    Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes before fluffing the rice with a fork. Garnish with fresh parsley (optional) and serve hot.
    
    Tips:
    
    You can substitute boneless, skinless chicken breasts for the chicken thighs. However, chicken thighs tend to be more flavorful in this recipe.
    Feel free to add other vegetables to this recipe, such as carrots, bell peppers, or broccoli. You can add them with the onion and garlic in step 1.
    If you prefer a richer flavor, you can use coconut milk instead of chicken broth.
    Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave.
    This recipe is a great way to get a delicious and satisfying meal on the table with minimal effort. Enjoy!</pre>
