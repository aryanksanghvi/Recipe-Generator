  <h2> Paneer Swirl Roll </h2>
  <pre>
    
    Ingredients:

For the Paneer Filling:

½ cup crumbled paneer (Indian cottage cheese)
1 tablespoon chopped green chili pepper (adjust for spice preference)
1 tablespoon chopped onion
¼ teaspoon chopped coriander leaves (cilantro)
¼ teaspoon turmeric powder
¼ teaspoon red chili powder (adjust for spice preference)
¼ teaspoon garam masala powder
Salt to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil (for cooking)
For the Dough:

1 cup whole wheat flour (atta)
½ cup all-purpose flour (maida)
½ teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
Warm water (about ¾ cup)
For Spreading (Optional):

1 tablespoon melted butter or ghee
Instructions:

Prepare the Paneer Filling: In a bowl, combine crumbled paneer, chopped green chili pepper, chopped onion, coriander leaves, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala powder, and salt. Mix well and set aside.

Make the Dough: In a large bowl, combine whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, and salt. Add vegetable oil and mix it in using your fingertips until crumbly. Gradually add warm water, kneading until a soft and elastic dough forms.

Knead and Rest: Knead the dough for about 5 minutes on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.

Roll and Spread: Divide the dough into 4 equal balls. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each ball into a thin circle, about 6-7 inches in diameter. If desired, brush the rolled-out dough with melted butter or ghee for extra flavor.

Spread the Filling: Sprinkle the prepared paneer filling evenly over the rolled-out dough, leaving a small border around the edge.

Swirl and Roll Up: Starting from one side, tightly roll up the dough with the filling inside, creating a log shape. Pinch the edges to seal the roll.

Cook the Rolls: Heat a griddle or tawa over medium heat. Place the rolled-up paneer swirls on the griddle and cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. You can gently press down on the rolls with a spatula while cooking to ensure even cooking.

Serve Hot:  Cut the paneer swirl rolls into slices and serve hot. You can enjoy them with your favorite chutney or dipping sauce.

Tips:

You can adjust the spice level of the filling by adding more or less green chili pepper and red chili powder.
For a richer flavor, add some grated cheese to the paneer filling.
If the dough feels too sticky while rolling, add a little bit more flour.
You can also cook the paneer swirl rolls in a pan with a little oil instead of using a griddle.</pre>
