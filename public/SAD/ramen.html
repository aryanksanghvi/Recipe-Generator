  <h2> Spicy Ramen  </h2>
  <pre>
    
    Ingredients (Base Recipe):

    2 servings of instant ramen noodles (or 200g fresh ramen noodles)
    4 cups chicken broth (or vegetable broth for a vegan option)
    1 tablespoon soy sauce
    1 tablespoon sriracha (or more to taste)
    1 tablespoon rice vinegar
    1 teaspoon sesame oil
    1 clove garlic, minced
    1 inch ginger, minced
    1 scallion, thinly sliced (green parts for garnish)
    Optional protein (cooked chicken, shrimp, tofu)
    Optional vegetables (sliced mushrooms, baby bok choy, bean sprouts)
    Spicy Gochujang Ramen (Increased Spice):
    
    In addition to the base recipe ingredients, you'll need:
    
    1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean chili paste)
    ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to your spice preference)
    Instructions:
    
    Prepare Broth: In a large pot, bring the chicken or vegetable broth to a simmer over medium heat. Add soy sauce, sriracha, rice vinegar, sesame oil, garlic, and ginger. Let simmer for 5 minutes to allow flavors to meld.
    Cook Noodles: If using instant ramen, follow package instructions for cooking noodles. Drain the noodles, reserving about ½ cup of the cooking water. If using fresh ramen, cook according to package instructions in a separate pot of boiling water. Drain and set aside.
    Add Protein and Vegetables (Optional): If using protein or vegetables, add them to the simmering broth and cook until heated through (usually 2-3 minutes for shrimp or chicken, slightly longer for tofu or vegetables).
    Combine and Serve: Add cooked ramen noodles and any reserved cooking water to the pot with the broth. Toss to coat the noodles in the flavorful broth.
    Garnish and Enjoy: Ladle the spicy ramen into individual bowls. Garnish with thinly sliced scallions (green parts) and a drizzle of additional sriracha or chili oil (optional).
    Spicy Garlic Ramen (Milder Spice):
    
    In addition to the base recipe ingredients, you'll need:
    
    1 teaspoon chili flakes (adjust to your spice preference)
    1 tablespoon honey or brown sugar
    Instructions:
    
    Follow steps 1-3 from the Gochujang Ramen recipe above.
    Combine and Simmer: Add cooked ramen noodles and any reserved cooking water to the pot with the broth. Toss to coat the noodles and simmer for an additional 1-2 minutes to allow the flavors to further develop.
    Garnish and Enjoy: Ladle the spicy ramen into individual bowls. Garnish with thinly sliced scallions (green parts) and sesame seeds.
    Tips:
    
    Feel free to adjust the amount of sriracha, gochujang, or chili flakes to achieve your desired level of spice.
    For a richer broth, add a tablespoon of miso paste along with the other seasonings.
    Get creative with toppings! You can add a soft-boiled egg, crumbled seaweed (wakame), or your favorite kimchi.
    Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. However, the noodles may become slightly mushy upon reheating.
    Enjoy your delicious and customizable spicy ramen!</pre>
