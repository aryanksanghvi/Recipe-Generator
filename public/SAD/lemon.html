  <h2>Lemon Yogurt Cheesecake</h2>
  <pre>
    
    Ingredients:

Crust:
1 1/4 cups graham cracker crumbs
3 tablespoons melted butter
2 tablespoons brown sugar
Filling:
2 cups full-fat Greek yogurt
2/3 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons lemon zest
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon cornstarch
Instructions:

Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan.
In a small bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and brown sugar. Mix well and press firmly into the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake for 10 minutes and let cool slightly.
In a large bowl, whisk together yogurt, sugar, salt, eggs, vanilla extract, lemon zest, and lemon juice until smooth. In a separate bowl, whisk the cornstarch with a tablespoon of water until a slurry forms. Gradually add the cornstarch slurry to the yogurt mixture and whisk until fully incorporated.
Pour the filling over the cooled crust. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the edges are set and the center is slightly jiggly.
Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool completely in the oven with the door slightly ajar (this helps prevent cracking). Once cool, refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or overnight, before serving.</pre>
