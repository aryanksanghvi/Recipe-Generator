  <h2>Lentil Curry with Cauliflower Rice</h2>
  <pre>
    
    Ingredients:

For the Lentil Curry:

1 cup dried brown lentils, rinsed
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 inch ginger, grated
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1/2 teaspoon coriander powder
1/4 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust for spice preference)
1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1 cup vegetable broth (or water)
1 cup coconut milk (full-fat or light)
Salt to taste
Fresh cilantro (optional, for garnish)
For the Cauliflower Rice:

1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
1 tablespoon olive oil (or butter)
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
Instructions:

1. Cook the Cauliflower Rice:

Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
In a food processor, pulse the cauliflower florets until they resemble rice-sized pieces. Alternatively, you can grate the cauliflower using the coarse grater attachment.
Spread the cauliflower rice on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil (or melted butter). Season with salt and pepper.
Roast in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the cauliflower rice is tender and slightly golden brown. Stir the rice halfway through baking.
2. Make the Lentil Curry:

In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat.

Add the chopped onion and saute until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.

Add the minced garlic and grated ginger and cook for another minute, until fragrant.

Stir in the ground cumin, turmeric powder, coriander powder, and red chili powder. Cook for a minute, allowing the spices to release their aroma.

Add the rinsed lentils and diced tomatoes (with their juices) to the pot.

Pour in the vegetable broth (or water) and coconut milk.

Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover the pot, and simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the lentils are tender but still have a slight bite. Stir occasionally.

3. Finishing Touches:

Once the lentils are cooked and the curry has thickened slightly, season with salt to taste.
You can adjust the consistency of the curry by adding more water or vegetable broth if it's too thick, or by simmering it uncovered for a few minutes to thicken it further.
4. Serve and Enjoy:

Divide the cooked cauliflower rice between bowls and top it with the lentil curry.
Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves (optional) and serve hot.
Tips:

Spicier Curry: For a bolder flavor, add a pinch of cayenne pepper or a chopped green chili pepper along with the other spices.
Creamier Curry: For an extra creamy texture, you can increase the amount of coconut milk used in the recipe.
Leftovers: Store leftover lentil curry and cauliflower rice in separate airtight containers in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop until warmed through.
Flavor Variations: You can add other vegetables to the curry like chopped carrots, bell peppers, or spinach.
Protein Boost: If desired, you can add cooked chickpeas or chopped tofu to the curry for extra protein.
Enjoy this delicious and healthy Lentil Curry with Cauliflower Rice!
