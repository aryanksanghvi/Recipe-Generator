  <h2>Paneer Bhurji</h2>
  <pre>
    
    Ingredients:

200 grams paneer (Indian cottage cheese)
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds (optional)
1/4 teaspoon asafoetida (hing)
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1 green chili pepper, chopped (adjust for spice preference)
1 inch ginger, grated
1 medium tomato, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust for spice preference)
1/4 teaspoon coriander powder
Salt to taste
1/4 cup chopped fresh coriander leaves (cilantro)
1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional)
Instructions:

Prepare the Paneer:  Crumble the paneer with your hands or grate it using a box grater. Set it aside.

Heat the Oil: In a pan or skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat.

Temper the Spices: Add the cumin seeds and fennel seeds (if using) to the hot oil. Once they sizzle, add the asafoetida (hing) and cook for a few seconds, taking care not to burn it.

Saut√© the Onion and Spices:  Add the chopped onion to the pan and saute until softened and translucent.

Add Ginger and Green Chili:  Add the grated ginger and chopped green chili pepper to the pan and saute for another minute, until fragrant.

Cook the Tomatoes:  Add the chopped tomatoes to the pan and cook until they soften and become mushy. Stir occasionally to prevent burning.

Spice it Up: Add the turmeric powder, red chili powder, and coriander powder to the masala (spice mixture) and cook for another minute, stirring constantly to release the aroma of the spices.

Incorporate the Paneer: Add the crumbled paneer to the pan and mix gently to combine it with the masala.

Season and Adjust:  Season the paneer bhurji with salt to taste. You can adjust the amount of red chili powder for your desired level of spiciness.

Finishing Touches:  Stir in the chopped fresh coriander leaves and lemon juice (if using) for added flavor and freshness.

Serve Hot:  Gently heat through for a minute or two and then turn off the heat. Serve the paneer bhurji hot with roti (flatbread), paratha (stuffed flatbread), naan bread, or rice.
You can also enjoy it as a filling for sandwiches or wraps.

Tips:

Soak the Paneer (Optional): For a softer texture, you can soak the paneer in warm water for about 15-20 minutes before crumbling it.
Adjust Vegetables: You can add other vegetables to the paneer bhurji like chopped bell peppers, peas, or capsicum.
Spice Variations: For a richer flavor, you can add a pinch of garam masala powder along with the other spices.
Leftovers: Store leftover paneer bhurji in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat gently in a pan over medium heat until warmed through.
Enjoy making and savoring this delicious paneer bhurji!</pre>
