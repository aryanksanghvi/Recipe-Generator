  <h2>Spinach Egg Sandwich</h2>
  <pre>
    
Ingredients:

1 slice of bread (your choice - whole wheat, English muffin, etc.)
1 large egg
1 handful of baby spinach
1 tablespoon butter or olive oil
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)
Optional toppings: cheese slice, sliced tomato, avocado slices
Instructions:

Toast the Bread: Toast your bread slice in a toaster, oven, or pan until golden brown and crisp.
Saute the Spinach: In a pan over medium heat, melt the butter or heat the olive oil. Add the spinach and garlic powder (if using) and cook until wilted, about 1-2 minutes.
Season with salt and pepper.
Cook the Egg: Push the spinach to one side of the pan and crack the egg into the open space. Cook to your desired doneness.
Assemble the Sandwich: Place the spinach on one side of the toasted bread. Carefully slide the cooked egg on top of the spinach.
Add cheese (optional) and other desired toppings like sliced tomato or avocado slices.
Serve and Enjoy: Season with additional salt and pepper if needed, and enjoy your delicious and satisfying breakfast sandwich!
Tips:

Spicing it Up: Feel free to add a pinch of red pepper flakes or your favorite herbs (chopped chives, parsley) to the spinach while it's sauteing for an extra flavor boost.
Leftovers: While not ideal, leftover breakfast sandwiches can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 hours. Reheat gently in a pan or microwave until warmed through.
The bread may become slightly soggy upon reheating.
Make-Ahead Option: You can pre-cook the spinach and eggs and assemble the sandwich in the morning for a quick and easy breakfast on the go.
Enjoy your delicious and healthy Spinach and Egg Breakfast Sandwich!</pre>
