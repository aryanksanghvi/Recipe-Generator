  <h2>Delicious Dal Makhani </h2>
  <pre>
    
    Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup basmati rice
- 4 cups whole milk
- 1/3 cup sugar (adjust to taste)
- 1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder
- 10-12 saffron strands (optional)
- 2 tablespoons chopped nuts (almonds, cashews, pistachios)
- 1 tablespoon raisins
- Ghee (clarified butter) for frying nuts and raisins

Instructions:
1. Rinse the basmati rice under running water until the water runs clear. Drain and set aside.
2. Turn on the Instant Pot to the sauté mode and heat some ghee in it.
3. Add chopped nuts and raisins. Sauté until the nuts turn golden brown and the raisins plump up. Remove and set aside.
4. Add the rinsed and drained rice to the Instant Pot and roast it for about 1-2 minutes.
5. Pour in the whole milk and give it a good stir to ensure nothing is sticking to the bottom of the pot.
6. Close the lid of the Instant Pot, set the valve to the sealing position, and cook on high pressure for 20 minutes.
7. Once the cooking cycle is complete, allow for a natural pressure release for about 10 minutes. Then release any remaining pressure manually.
8. Open the lid and give the kheer a good stir. The mixture will thicken as it cools down.
9. Add sugar, cardamom powder, saffron strands, and the fried nuts and raisins. Mix well.
10. Let it cool for a bit before serving, or you can enjoy it warm as well.
11. Garnish with more nuts and saffron strands before serving.
